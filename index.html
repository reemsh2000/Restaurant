            While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in your
            diet, many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain no
            nutritional<br />
            value. According to a study conducted by the University of Florida,
            the brain releases heroin-like chemicals called endogenous
            opioids<br />
            when an individual indulges on sweet, salty or fatty foods.

                One of the reasons why so many people end up eating unhealthy
                snacks is simply because they don’t consider taking the time to
                source healthier alternatives.
